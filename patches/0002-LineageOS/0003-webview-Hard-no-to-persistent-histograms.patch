Subject: [PATCH] webview: Hard no to persistent histograms

* It's probably some kind of bug somewhere that these are never
  deleted, but they don't really add value to us in the first
  place.
* Stop eating 4MB every single time any app that uses webview
  ever opens.
* These were guarded by a feature check before
