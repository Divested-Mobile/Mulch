Mulch
=====
The DivestOS WebView

Goals
-----
- Minimizing anti-features
- Included patches must be very simple to minimize maintenance
- Becoming a "privacy" browser is out of scope, use Mull instead

Notes
-----
- This repo will only keep one version at a time
- This repo will be reinitialized often
- x86 and x86_64 will track from LineageOS due to excessive compile times
